    1. Explain why do we want sometimes to use setImmediate instead of using setTimeout?<br>
setTimeout runs in Timer phase, setImmediate runs in check phase. For example: If
there's a case needs to run just before close phase, we can use setImmediate.
var fs = require('fs'); var path = require('path');
fs.readFile(path.join(__dirname, 'greet.txt'), 'utf8', function(err, data) {
setTimeout(() => { console.log('timeout'); }, 0);
setImmediate(() => { console.log('immediate'); });
process.nextTick(() => console.log('nexttick')); });<br>
2. Explain the difference between process.nextTick and setImmediate?<br>
callback of process.nextTick get executed multiple chances in one iteration - highest priotiry.
setImmediate only get executed once in one cycle.
how many callbacks will be executed in one iteration? process.nextTick() - all of callbacks in
nextTick queue, drain out - Don't use while true loop on process.nextTick, will block event
loop. setImmediate - certain, the remaining for next iteration/tick
process.nextTick - API provided natively by Node.js setImmediate - provided by libuv
